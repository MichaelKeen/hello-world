Hello, 
When I first remember realizing that the Universe was a far grander place then my life had so far implied, I was a boy looking into a dust filled beam of sunlight. While I watched, the currents and eddies of the sunsoaked air caused the motes of dust to tremble and dance, whirling through patterns of complexity and beauty. I watched as gallaxies formed and disolved, and it occured to me that I was actually observing star light.

And so began my love affair with the world behind the world.
